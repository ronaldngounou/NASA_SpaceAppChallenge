Soils are classified into seven basic groups plus eight subgroups, for a total of fifteen for mineral soils. Another class for organic soils is used. The groups are based on determinations of particle-size distribution, liquid limit, and plasticity index. The group classification, including group index, is useful in determining the relative quality of the soil material for use in earthwork structures, particularly embankments, subgrades, subbases, and bases.

The basis for identifying highly erodible land is the erodibility index of a soil survey map unit. The erodibility index of a soil is determined by dividing the potential erodibility for each soil survey map unit by the soil loss tolerance (T) value established for the soil. The potential erodibility for a map unit differs according to the erosion type (water or wind erosion). The T value represents the maximum annual rate of soil erosion that could take place without causing a decline in long-term productivity. A soil map unit with an erodibility index of 8 or more is a highly erodible soil map unit. For water erosion, a soil survey map unit is potentially highly erodible if: (1) the RKLS/T value using the minimum LS factor is less than 8 and (2) the RKLS/T value using the maximum LS factor is equal to or greater than 8.
