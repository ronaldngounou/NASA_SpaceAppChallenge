Idea #1:
- We are going to work with an environmental data set 
- Visualize it in a way where people can interact with it
- A platform to browse datasets is what we're trying to ideally do
- Go on data.gov and grab the data metadata and then feed it to LDA to do topic analysis

Idea #2:
- Use one of the datasets that they provide
- Use Earthdata Search to build a dashboard using Tableau

Idea #3:
- Write a Python program that makes download the data, put it into Tableau,
- visualize it.

- We are only working with CSV
- We are going to write a script to grab CSV files that are the right size and download it
- Store the data in the cloud
- And then have Tableau point to the datalake and visualize it

- We probably need two people to work on backend/engineering
- Two people to work on frontend

- Dataset 1:
-
